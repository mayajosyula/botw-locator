A project based on chapter 2 of the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/). Upload a screenshot from a game of Breath of the Wild, and this attempts to recognize which tower region it was taken in. 

This is currently incomplete (as of now, covers Hebra Tower, Eldin Tower, Gerudo Tower, Wasteland Tower, Ridgeland Tower, Faron Tower).

Training data was taken from the [Breath of the Wild walkthrough](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough/) and the [Korok seed locations list](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough/korok-seed-locations/) at zeldadungeon.net.
